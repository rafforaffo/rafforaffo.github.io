      The word mathematics derives from the ancient Greek word <strong>μάθημα</strong> (máthema) which means <i>science, knowledge</i>, that derives itself from the verb <strong>μανθάνω</strong> (manthano) which means <i>to learn</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence mathematics has been elevated since its origin to "the science of science".
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many intellectuals that provided several definitions and discussion around mathematics. To cite only one of them, the positivist philosoper Auguste Comte did not include mathematics among with other sciences, because in his opinion it is the fundamental ground to all the disciplines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, mathematics can also be seen as a form of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of a universal form of beauty may be debatable; however, many masterpieces, e.g. paintings or sculptures or musical composition, are widely regarded as beautiful. Nowadays, the art is grouped in visive, uditive and performative. I believe that near these three forms we should consider another one that is based on the human intellectual skills, namely logic. In this sense mathematics should be considered a form of art.
